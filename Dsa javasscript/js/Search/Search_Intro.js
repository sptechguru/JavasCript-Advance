Search in Data of array  are Used in 

There are two Types Algoritms:- 

1) Linear Search :- Only performed Sorted array Asending & Descendig order
in sorted array for single Loop is Iterated or using reaursive Function also 
are used in Linear Search.
Example:- Single Loop 
This completxity of 0(n)  
speace complexity is 0(log)


2) Non Linear Search   
Example :-  of Graph & Tree are using Nodes for Multiple or Two  Loops are used.
This completxity of 0(n)^2  
speace complexity is 0(log)n
