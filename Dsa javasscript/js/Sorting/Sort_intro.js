let sorting = `
The sort() sorts the elements of an array. The sort() overwrites
 the original array. The sort() sorts the elements as strings in alphabetical
  and ascending order. & Descending Order.

 let Types_of_Sorting = `
 There are 6 types of Sorting in javascript 

 1) Bubble Sort  : for using swap vaible i & j 
 //Swapping Withought using Third vairaibles
 [arr[j + 1],arr[j]] = [arr[j],arr[j + 1]];

 2) Selection Sort :
   Front  Order of arry itertion. inner loop start let arr = j = i+ 1;

 3) Insertion Sort :
  Reverse Order of arry itertion. intial loop start with let i =1;

 4) Merge Sort 
 5) Quick Sort
 6) Heap Sort : Not Working javascript

let Merge_sort_4 = `Merge Sort is Based On Divide & Conquer arr Partition 
of array is two parts & Divide array in Asending & Desending Order.
find a Midvalue is Merge Sort Algorithms
Ex midValue = arr.length /2;
`; 


let Quick_sort_5 = `Quick Sort is Based Of Centilized in Pivot & Partition 
of array in Asending & Desending Order.
find a Pivot your Choice for . .
Ex1: midValue = arr.length /2;
Ex2: arrLastElement = arr.length-1;
Ex3: arrFirstElement = arr[0];
Ex4: Randam value  =  any where ?

let Time_comPlexity = `

All Sorting Time Compexity is double of array size in 

Worst-case time complexity: Big O (n^2).
Average-case time complexity: Big theta (n^2).
Best-case time complexity: Big omega (n).
Space complexity: Big O (1).
