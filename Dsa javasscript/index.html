WHAT IS DATA STRUCTURE?
A data structure is a group of data elements that provides the easiest way to store and perform different actions on the data of the computer. A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. The idea is to reduce the space and time complexities of different tasks. 

The choice of a good data structure makes it possible to perform a variety of critical operations effectively. An efficient data structure also uses minimum memory space and execution time to process the structure. A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge of data structures.

Need Of Data structure:
The structure of the data and the synthesis of the algorithm are relative to each other. Data presentation must be easy to understand so the developer, as well as the user, can make an efficient implementation of the operation.
Data structures provide an easy way of organizing, retrieving, managing, and storing data.

Here is a list of the needs for data.

Data structure modification is easy. 
It requires less time. 
Save storage memory space. 
Data representation is easy. 
Easy access to the large database
Classification/Types of Data Structures:
Linear Data Structure
Non-Linear Data Structure.
Linear Data Structure:

Elements are arranged in one dimension ,also known as linear dimension.
Example: lists, stack, queue, etc.
 Non-Linear Data Structure
Elements are arranged in one-many, many-one and many-many dimensions.
Example: tree, graph, table, etc.
Classification of Data Structure

 
Most Popular Data Structures: 
1. Array: An array is a collection of data items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).
